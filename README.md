# 🚀 GitHub Actions Cache Server

This is a drop-in replacement for the official GitHub hosted cache server. It is compatible with the official `actions/cache` action, so there is no need to change your workflow files and it even works with packages that internally use `actions/cache`.

## Features

- 🔥 **Compatible with official `actions/cache` action**
- 📦 Supports multiple storage solutions and is easily extendable.
- 🔒 Secure and self-hosted, giving you full control over your cache data.
- 😎 Easy setup

  cache-server:
    image: ghcr.io/falcondev-oss/github-actions-cache-server

## Management dashboard

Set `MANAGEMENT_API_KEY` to enable the management API and open `/management` on the server. The dashboard accepts that key in the browser session and shows cache entries, storage usage, upload activity, cache hit rate, and the busiest scopes and repositories.
